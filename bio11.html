Because cells must perform many chemical reactions in order to function properly.
2 •  Because most chemical reactions naturally happen very slowly.
3 •  Increasing temperature.
4 •  It requires a lot of energy and is not practical for keeping an entire organism warm.
5 •  High temperatures can damage cells.
6 •  It also speeds up unwanted reactions that should not happen.
7 •  A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being changed or used up.
8 •  It means the catalyst can work again and again.
9 •  Because they are not changed or used up during the reaction.
10 •  A catalyst is a general term, while an enzyme is a biological catalyst made by living organisms.
11 •  Because enzymes are catalysts that organisms produce.
12 •  Enzymes are proteins.
13 •  Proteins are made of long chains of amino acids.
14 •  When the amino acid chains fold into complex shapes, they form unique enzymes.
15 •  To catalyze means to speed up a chemical reaction.
16 •  A substrate.
17 •  Products.
18 •  They can break one substrate into multiple products.
19 •  They can join multiple substrates to form a single product.
20 •  The active site.
21 •  Because only the correct substrate can fit into it.
22 •  The reaction will not be catalyzed.
23 •  Because each enzyme’s active site has a unique shape for a specific substrate.
24 •  The lock and key model.
25 •  The substrate fits perfectly into the active site like a key into a lock.
26 •  The induced fit model.
27 •  The enzyme changes shape slightly to fit the substrate more closely.
28 •  Because real enzymes are flexible and adjust to the substrate.
29 •  The shape determines what substrate the enzyme can bind to.
30 •  A better fit helps the reaction happen more efficiently.
31 •  The shape allows only certain substrates to bind, so function depends on structure.
32 •  Because each enzyme’s active site only matches specific substrates.
33 •  Because different reactions need different enzymes.
34 •  Life processes would be too slow to support life.
35 •  Heat is dangerous, but enzymes speed up reactions safely.
36 •  Enzymes reduce the need for extra heat or energy.
37 •  Each substrate fits only a matching active site.
38 •  Because the active site shape only matches one substrate.
39 •  Because they are not changed or used up in the reaction.
40 •  It shows that without enzymes speeding up reactions, living cells could not function fast enough to stay alive.
