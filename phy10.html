  <h1>Wind &amp; Solar Power — Questions</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">40 quick Q&amp;A for revision</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What two renewable energy sources are discussed in the video?<span class="answer">→ Wind and solar power.</span></li>
    <li>What device is used to capture wind power?<span class="answer">→ Wind turbines.</span></li>
    <li>Where are wind turbines usually placed?<span class="answer">→ In exposed areas like moors or coasts.</span></li>
    <li>Why are moors and coasts good locations for wind turbines?<span class="answer">→ Because they have strong, consistent winds.</span></li>
    <li>What does each wind turbine contain inside?<span class="answer">→ A generator.</span></li>
    <li>What turns the generator inside a wind turbine?<span class="answer">→ The spinning blades.</span></li>
    <li>What kind of energy is converted by the spinning blades?<span class="answer">→ Kinetic energy.</span></li>
    <li>What type of energy does the generator produce?<span class="answer">→ Electrical energy.</span></li>
    <li>Where is the generated electricity transported to?<span class="answer">→ The national grid.</span></li>
    <li>What captures solar power?<span class="answer">→ Solar cells (solar panels).</span></li>
    <li>What form do solar cells usually take?<span class="answer">→ Panels.</span></li>
    <li>What do solar panels generate directly from sunlight?<span class="answer">→ Electric current.</span></li>
    <li>What natural process is solar energy compared to?<span class="answer">→ Photosynthesis.</span></li>
    <li>Name a small device that uses solar energy well.<span class="answer">→ A watch or calculator.</span></li>
    <li>Why don’t solar-powered watches and calculators need new batteries?<span class="answer">→ Because sunlight powers them directly.</span></li>
    <li>Where are solar panels especially useful besides small devices?<span class="answer">→ In remote regions.</span></li>
    <li>Why are solar panels useful in the Australian outback?<span class="answer">→ Because it’s remote and not connected to the power grid.</span></li>
    <li>How is solar energy being used on a larger scale today?<span class="answer">→ To generate electricity for entire towns.</span></li>
    <li>What is a shared advantage of wind and solar power?<span class="answer">→ Very low running costs.</span></li>
    <li>What greenhouse gas do they not produce?<span class="answer">→ Carbon dioxide (CO₂).</span></li>
    <li>Do wind and solar have high or low running costs?<span class="answer">→ Low.</span></li>
    <li>Do wind and solar produce pollutants while operating?<span class="answer">→ No.</span></li>
    <li>What is a shared disadvantage of wind and solar?<span class="answer">→ High upfront (installation) costs.</span></li>
    <li>What makes solar cell manufacturing a bit polluting?<span class="answer">→ The production process releases pollutants.</span></li>
    <li>Why do wind and solar depend on weather conditions?<span class="answer">→ They need wind or sunlight to generate electricity.</span></li>
    <li>What happens if the wind doesn’t blow?<span class="answer">→ Wind turbines don’t produce power.</span></li>
    <li>What happens if the sun doesn’t shine?<span class="answer">→ Solar panels don’t produce power.</span></li>
    <li>Can wind or solar increase supply instantly during peak demand?<span class="answer">→ No, they can’t.</span></li>
    <li>Why do they take up a lot of space?<span class="answer">→ Many units are needed to generate large amounts of power.</span></li>
    <li>What complaint do some people have about wind turbines’ appearance?<span class="answer">→ They don’t look nice.</span></li>
    <li>What other complaint do people make about wind turbines?<span class="answer">→ They are too noisy.</span></li>
    <li>Do wind and solar damage the environment during use?<span class="answer">→ No.</span></li>
    <li>Are wind and solar becoming cheaper or more expensive each year?<span class="answer">→ Cheaper.</span></li>
    <li>What type of energy do wind turbines convert into electricity?<span class="answer">→ Kinetic energy.</span></li>
    <li>What type of energy do solar cells convert into electricity?<span class="answer">→ Light (solar) energy.</span></li>
    <li>Which has higher upfront costs — fossil fuels or renewables?<span class="answer">→ Renewables (wind and solar).</span></li>
    <li>Why are high upfront costs a disadvantage?<span class="answer">→ Because they require large investment before generating profit.</span></li>
    <li>Are wind and solar good long-term energy options?<span class="answer">→ Yes, they’re sustainable and clean.</span></li>
    <li>Do wind and solar emit carbon dioxide while running?<span class="answer">→ No.</span></li>
    <li>What is the overall trend for renewable energy technology costs?<span class="answer">→ They are decreasing every year.</span></li>
