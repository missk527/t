  <h1>Fossils, Evolution & Extinction — Short Questions with Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What are fossils?<br>→ Remains or traces left behind by long-dead organisms.</li>
    <li>Give two examples of what a fossil might be.<br>→ A skeleton turned to rock; an impression like a footprint.</li>
    <li>Why are fossils important to scientists?<br>→ They show how life forms have changed over time.</li>
    <li>What does the study of fossils tell us about organisms over time?<br>→ It shows gradual evolutionary changes.</li>
    <li>Fossils provide evidence for which major scientific theory?<br>→ Evolution.</li>
    <li>How many main ways of fossil formation are described in the video?<br>→ Three.</li>
    <li>What is the most common way fossils form?<br>→ Gradual replacement by minerals.</li>
    <li>In gradual replacement by minerals, which body parts decay slowly?<br>→ Bones, teeth, and shells.</li>
    <li>What replaces the decaying hard parts to form fossils?<br>→ Minerals.</li>
    <li>What is left behind after mineral replacement is complete?<br>→ A rock-like replica of the original structure.</li>
    <li>What do we call the type of fossil that forms when an organism buried in clay decays, leaving a mould?<br>→ A cast.</li>
    <li>Give one example of something that can leave a cast.<br>→ An animal burrow or plant root.</li>
    <li>What is an impression fossil?<br>→ A mark or imprint left by an organism.</li>
    <li>Give one example of an impression fossil.<br>→ A footprint.</li>
    <li>Name one place where complete preservation can occur with no decay.<br>→ Amber, tar pits, glaciers, or peat bogs.</li>
    <li>Why does decay not happen in amber or tar pits?<br>→ Because there is no oxygen or moisture.</li>
    <li>Why can organisms be preserved in glaciers?<br>→ It’s too cold for microorganisms to survive.</li>
    <li>Why do peat bogs prevent decay?<br>→ They are too acidic for microorganisms.</li>
    <li>The oldest fossils found so far are roughly how old?<br>→ Around 3 to 4 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Why is the fossil record incomplete?<br>→ Many fossils are missing or destroyed; early life forms decayed quickly.</li>
    <li>What kind of organisms were the earliest life forms?<br>→ Soft-bodied organisms.</li>
    <li>Why are fossils of early soft-bodied organisms unlikely to exist?<br>→ They decayed too quickly to fossilize.</li>
    <li>Name one geological process that can destroy fossils over time.<br>→ Volcanoes or earthquakes.</li>
    <li>How can the movement of tectonic plates affect fossils?<br>→ It can destroy or distort them through heat and pressure.</li>
    <li>What is extinction?<br>→ When no individuals of a species remain.</li>
    <li>What does it mean when a species has gone extinct?<br>→ The species has completely died out.</li>
    <li>Give one possible cause of extinction related to environmental change.<br>→ Habitat destruction or rapid global warming.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a human activity that has caused extinction.<br>→ Over-hunting.</li>
    <li>How can a new predator cause a species to go extinct?<br>→ By killing them faster than they can reproduce.</li>
    <li>How can a new disease lead to extinction?<br>→ It spreads through a population and kills them.</li>
    <li>What does it mean when a new species “out-competes” another?<br>→ It uses food or resources more effectively, leaving none for the other species.</li>
    <li>What catastrophic event is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs?<br>→ An asteroid impact.</li>
    <li>Approximately how many years ago did the dinosaur extinction event occur?<br>→ About 66 million years ago.</li>
    <li>What country did the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs hit?<br>→ Mexico.</li>
    <li>What evidence from fossils shows that evolution has occurred?<br>→ Fossils reveal small, gradual changes between species over time.</li>
    <li>Why is it difficult to know how life first began on Earth?<br>→ Early fossils are missing, and soft-bodied organisms decayed too fast.</li>
    <li>What conditions stop microorganisms from carrying out decay?<br>→ Lack of oxygen, lack of moisture, low temperature, or high acidity.</li>
    <li>Name two natural materials that can trap and preserve organisms.<br>→ Amber and tar.</li>
    <li>Which part of an organism is least likely to form a fossil?<br>→ Soft tissue.</li>
    <li>Summarize one reason why studying fossils is important for understanding life on Earth.<br>→ They help us understand how species evolved and why some became extinct.</li>
