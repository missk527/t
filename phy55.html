1. Terminal velocity is when a falling object’s speed becomes constant and it no longer accelerates.
2. No, it is not accelerating anymore.
3. Weight (gravity) pulls a person downward.
4. Weight is caused by gravity acting on mass.
5. No, weight stays the same during the fall.
6. Weight is the only force at the moment they step out.
7. The combination of all forces is called the resultant force.
8. They will accelerate downwards.
9. Air resistance opposes weight.
10. Drag.
11. Air resistance is caused by collisions with air particles.
12. Greater surface area → more air resistance.
13. Higher velocity → more air resistance.
14. It is small at the start.
15. Because the person is not moving very fast yet, so fewer air collisions.
16. Yes, the person still accelerates downward.
17. It increases.
18. It decreases (because drag cancels more of the weight).
19. The slope becomes less steep.
20. The forces balance and the person reaches terminal velocity.
21. Zero.
22. Acceleration becomes zero.
23. It becomes constant.
24. A constant speed where weight = air resistance.
25. It increases a lot.
26. Air resistance increases sharply.
27. The resultant force is upwards.
28. Because drag becomes greater than weight, slowing them down.
29. It decreases.
30. They become equal again.
31. Yes, a new terminal velocity is reached.
32. Lower than before.
33. Because the larger surface area creates more drag.
34. Weight is bigger.
35. Air resistance increases.
36. Acceleration becomes zero.
37. Velocity must become constant.
38. Opening a parachute.
39. Because surface area increases suddenly → drag jumps up, slowing them fast.
40. The parachute creates enough drag to keep them falling slowly and safely.
