<h1>Answer Key – Hydroelectricity & Tidal Barrages (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>They both use water held at different heights (a difference in water levels).</li>
<li>It blocks the flow so the water level becomes much higher on one side than the other.</li>
<li>Gravitational potential energy.</li>
<li>From the river upstream of the dam.</li>
<li>It is called a reservoir.</li>
<li>Because it is a large, wide area of stored water behind the dam.</li>
<li>Tides are the cyclic rise and fall of sea levels.</li>
<li>They are mainly caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon.</li>
<li>Usually two high tides each day.</li>
<li>In estuaries, where rivers meet the sea.</li>
<li>An estuary is the place where a river meets the ocean.</li>
<li>A tidal barrage is a large dam built across an estuary to trap tidal water.</li>
<li>When the tide comes in, during high tide.</li>
<li>There is a much higher water level on one side of the barrage than on the other.</li>
<li>The difference in water height (water level) between the two sides.</li>
<li>The turbines.</li>
<li>The generator.</li>
<li>It flows back into the river or sea on the other side of the dam.</li>
<li>No, they generate electricity with no pollution while they are running.</li>
<li>They are described as very reliable sources of electricity.</li>
<li>They can provide an immediate response and start generating more power very quickly.</li>
<li>Their running costs are fairly low.</li>
<li>Yes, they can work on both large and small scales.</li>
<li>They often have a big impact on the surrounding environment.</li>
<li>They can flood huge areas of land.</li>
<li>Important habitats such as forests, wetlands and farmland.</li>
<li>Whole villages can be submerged and people may have to move.</li>
<li>They may stop boats from traveling up or down the river.</li>
<li>They may block fish from swimming along the river.</li>
<li>Fish migrations.</li>
<li>The initial setup cost is often expensive.</li>
<li>Running costs are low compared with the high initial construction cost.</li>
<li>It is the stored energy in the high water that can be turned into electricity.</li>
<li>Gravitational potential energy is changed into electrical energy.</li>
<li>Because tides regularly rise and fall in a repeating cycle.</li>
<li>A hydroelectric dam.</li>
<li>A tidal barrage.</li>
<li>Example: They produce electricity with no direct pollution while operating.</li>
<li>Example: They can damage the environment and block fish and boat movements.</li>
<li>Because they are expensive and can flood land, destroy habitats, or disturb local communities and wildlife.</li>
