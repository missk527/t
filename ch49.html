Answer Key
1. Le Chatelier’s principle
2. Reversible reactions
3. The balance between reactants and products at equilibrium
4. Left
5. Right
6. It shifts to counteract (oppose) the change
7. Ammonia production from nitrogen and hydrogen
8. Nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂)
9. Ammonia (NH₃)
10. So no particles can escape; conditions can be controlled (sealed system)
11. Exothermic
12. It releases energy to the surroundings
13. Endothermic
14. Because forward and backward reactions are opposites
15. Toward the exothermic direction
16. Right
17. More products (more ammonia)
18. Toward the endothermic direction
19. More nitrogen and hydrogen (fewer ammonia particles)
20. Number of particles per unit volume
21. It moves to the side with fewer gas molecules
22. The right side
23. 4 molecules (1 N₂ + 3 H₂)
24. 2 molecules (2 NH₃)
25. To the right
26. To the side with more molecules
27. Reactants side has more
28. Left
29. Concentration changes
30. To the right
31. More ammonia
32. Equilibrium shifts to oppose the change
33. It must use up the added nitrogen
34. Increases
35. It tries to restore equilibrium by opposing the change
36. The forward reaction
37. They decrease
38. Decreases
39. Because lowering temperature favors the exothermic (right) direction, making more ammonia
40. Because the right side has fewer gas molecules, so high pressure pushes equilibrium toward ammonia
