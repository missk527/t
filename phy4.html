<h1>Conservation of Energy – Core Concept</h1>
<ol>
<li>Energy can be transferred, stored, or dissipated but never created or destroyed.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Transferred usefully, stored, or dissipated.</li>
<li>It means energy spreads out into less useful forms.</li>
<li>Example: electrical energy → chemical energy in a phone battery.</li>
<li>Electrical energy from the mains is transferred to the phone battery.</li>
<li>The chemical energy store of the phone’s battery.</li>
<li>Electrical energy.</li>
<li>The screen, speaker, and other components.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Energy Transformations in the Phone Example</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>Electrical energy → light energy.</li>
<li>Electrical energy → sound energy.</li>
<li>Some energy is dissipated as heat.</li>
<li>Energy not transferred to the intended store/use.</li>
<li>Heat.</li>
<li>Sound energy (unwanted noise).</li>
<li>Because transfers are never 100% efficient.</li>
<li>All energy should be transferred usefully.</li>
<li>The phone becomes warm.</li>
<li>Because it spreads to the surroundings instead of powering the phone.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Systems in Physics</h2>
<ol start="21">
<li>A chosen portion of the physical universe to analyze.</li>
<li>The environment.</li>
<li>The phone.</li>
<li>Because it exchanges energy and matter with the environment.</li>
<li>Both energy and matter.</li>
<li>It gives out heat energy to the surroundings.</li>
<li>The environment.</li>
<li>A closed system does not exchange energy or matter with the environment.</li>
<li>The contents of the sealed jar (phone + air inside).</li>
<li>Because energy and matter cannot enter or escape.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Energy in Open vs Closed Systems</h2>
<ol start="31">
<li>To the air inside the jar.</li>
<li>Because energy is only transferred within the system.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Energy and matter can enter or leave.</li>
<li>Energy and matter cannot enter or leave.</li>
<li>Yes, it applies to all systems.</li>
<li>It can exchange energy and matter freely.</li>
<li>It cannot exchange energy or matter.</li>
<li>Because it helps explain how energy is transferred and conserved in real-life scenarios.</li>
