<h1>Answer Key – Ecology (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>All organisms have relationships with each other and the environment.</li>
<li>Example: mice have relationships with other mice / plants they eat / predators that eat them.</li>
<li>They breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Burrowing increases soil aeration/irrigation and improves soil quality.</li>
<li>They would have less food.</li>
<li>Soil quality may decrease because fewer mice are burrowing.</li>
<li>The place where an organism lives.</li>
<li>Field, forest, someone’s basement (any one).</li>
<li>All organisms of one species living in a habitat.</li>
<li>All the populations of different species living together in a habitat.</li>
<li>Mice, owls, plants (and other organisms in the field).</li>
<li>Living factors in the environment.</li>
<li>Food availability, number of predators (any two).</li>
<li>Non-living factors in the environment.</li>
<li>Temperature, soil pH (any two).</li>
<li>The interaction of a community of living organisms with the non-living parts of their environment.</li>
<li>Habitat + community + biotic & abiotic factors (all together).</li>
<li>How ecosystems function and how they might change in the future.</li>
<li>Because resources are limited.</li>
<li>Territory/space, food, water, mates (any two).</li>
<li>Light, space, water, mineral ions (any two).</li>
<li>Mineral nutrients from the soil.</li>
<li>Lions and hyenas competing for a wildebeest.</li>
<li>Male deer competing for females.</li>
<li>All species depend on other species in some way.</li>
<li>A diagram that shows feeding relationships in a community.</li>
<li>Grass.</li>
<li>Shrews and sparrows.</li>
<li>Grass decreases (mice eat more).</li>
<li>Their populations fall (less grass for them to eat).</li>
<li>Hawk population might increase (more mice to eat).</li>
<li>Because rabbits decrease, and hawks also rely on rabbits.</li>
<li>Their populations might fall (less grasshoppers to eat).</li>
<li>No; you don’t need exact numbers.</li>
<li>How a change in one species affects others (knock-on effects).</li>
<li>Mouse numbers may rise (fewer predators).</li>
<li>Rabbits and grasshoppers may increase (more food).</li>
<li>Connected — changes spread and affect many species.</li>
<li>A food web.</li>
<li>Understand relationships and how ecosystem changes cause knock-on effects.</li>
