1. Water and sugars
2. Translocation
3. In the leaves
4. Other plant parts need sugars for energy
5. Phloem
6. Long tubes / sieve tube columns
7. Liquid mixture of water and sugars
8. Water and dissolved sugars
9. Pores allow sap to pass cell to cell
10. Used for energy immediately
11. Stored for later use
12. Both directions
13. Xylem
14. Dead cells
15. No end walls → one long hollow tube
16. Lignin
17. Roots → stem → leaves
18. Needed for photosynthesis
19. Evaporation from leaves
20. They pull the next molecules upward
21. Evaporation pulls the chain upward
22. Transpiration stream
23. To allow CO₂ in
24. Carbon dioxide
25. Water vapor
26. Transpiration
27. Some evaporation always happens
28. Light, temperature, air flow, humidity
29. More light → stomata open → more evaporation
30. Stomata close in the dark
31. Warm air speeds evaporation and diffusion
32. Wind carries moist air away, keeping gradient high
33. Water is constantly brought from roots
34. Inside is moist, outside is drier
35. It diffuses down its concentration gradient
36. The strength of the concentration gradient
37. It decreases
38. Outside air is moist → smaller gradient
39. It increases
40. Less evaporation → less water movement
