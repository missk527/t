<h1>Answer Key – Biotic and Abiotic Factors (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>A biotic factor is any living factor that affects another organism or shapes the ecosystem.</li>
<li>An abiotic factor is any non-living part of the environment that affects organisms.</li>
<li>Biotic factors are living.</li>
<li>Abiotic factors are non-living.</li>
<li>Because it is a living process where one organism eats another and affects its population.</li>
<li>For example, two species competing for the same habitat or food resource.</li>
<li>Because disease is caused by living pathogens such as bacteria, viruses or fungi.</li>
<li>Because food is provided by other living organisms, like plants or prey animals.</li>
<li>Animals, plants, bacteria and any other living organisms.</li>
<li>They are usually described as chemical or physical parts of the environment.</li>
<li>Light intensity, temperature, and wind intensity/direction.</li>
<li>Soil pH and mineral content of the soil.</li>
<li>Light intensity is an abiotic factor.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide concentration is an abiotic factor.</li>
<li>It can increase the rate of photosynthesis because the enzymes involved can work faster (up to an optimum).</li>
<li>It can increase the overall rate of plant growth.</li>
<li>Animals may need to spend less energy keeping warm.</li>
<li>They might use more energy for growth or spend less time searching for food.</li>
<li>You are often asked to identify biotic and abiotic factors and explain what happens if they change.</li>
<li>You should think about all the ways living organisms affect one another.</li>
<li>It is “chilling out” by a sea anemone.</li>
<li>Because it is a living organism that provides habitat and affects the clownfish.</li>
<li>Bigger fish or eels are predators of the clownfish.</li>
<li>There can be competition for the sea anemone as a habitat.</li>
<li>There can be competition for plankton and algae that the clownfish eat.</li>
<li>It means the overall level of disease that the animals have to cope with.</li>
<li>For example, water temperature or oxygen concentration in the water.</li>
<li>It can change throughout the day or throughout the year.</li>
<li>Because the clownfish needs enough dissolved oxygen to respire and stay alive.</li>
<li>The levels of acidity (pH) and salt (salinity) in the water.</li>
<li>No, they might not affect the clownfish directly.</li>
<li>They can affect other species around it, such as the sea anemone and algae.</li>
<li>If the sea anemone is affected, the clownfish’s habitat and protection are also affected.</li>
<li>Because they can change other species, which then affect the organism through the food web.</li>
<li>Interactions like predation, competition, disease and food relationships.</li>
<li>Conditions like light, temperature, moisture, gases, soil pH, minerals, wind, and water properties.</li>
<li>Biotic factors shape an ecosystem by controlling interactions between living organisms and their populations.</li>
<li>Abiotic factors shape an ecosystem by setting the physical and chemical conditions that organisms must live in.</li>
<li>Because it helps us clearly see which influences come from living things and which come from the environment.</li>
<li>Because the clownfish depends on living things (like the sea anemone and its food) and on non-living conditions (like temperature and water chemistry) to survive.</li>
