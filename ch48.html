  <h1>Reversible Reactions & Equilibrium — Questions</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">40 quick Q&amp;A for revision</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What symbol shows a one-way reaction?<span class="answer">→ A single arrow (→).</span></li>
    <li>What does the right-pointing arrow (→) mean in a chemical equation?<span class="answer">→ Reactants change into products only (one direction).</span></li>
    <li>What does a double arrow (⇌) represent?<span class="answer">→ A reversible reaction.</span></li>
    <li>What type of reaction can go both forward and backward?<span class="answer">→ A reversible reaction.</span></li>
    <li>What is the forward reaction in the example of ammonium chloride?<span class="answer">→ NH₄Cl → NH₃ + HCl.</span></li>
    <li>What is the backward reaction in that same example?<span class="answer">→ NH₃ + HCl → NH₄Cl.</span></li>
    <li>Why is the ammonium chloride reaction called reversible?<span class="answer">→ Because both forward and backward reactions can occur.</span></li>
    <li>What happens to the backward reaction rate at the beginning?<span class="answer">→ It is zero (no products yet).</span></li>
    <li>Why is the forward reaction fast at the start?<span class="answer">→ Because there is lots of reactant and no product.</span></li>
    <li>What happens to the forward reaction rate over time?<span class="answer">→ It slows down.</span></li>
    <li>What happens to the backward reaction rate over time?<span class="answer">→ It speeds up.</span></li>
    <li>When both reaction rates become equal, what do we say the system has reached?<span class="answer">→ Equilibrium.</span></li>
    <li>At equilibrium, do reactions stop completely?<span class="answer">→ No.</span></li>
    <li>What continues to happen at equilibrium?<span class="answer">→ Both forward and backward reactions continue at equal rates.</span></li>
    <li>At equilibrium, do concentrations of reactants and products keep changing?<span class="answer">→ No, they remain constant.</span></li>
    <li>What do we call it when the concentrations stay constant but reactions still occur?<span class="answer">→ Dynamic equilibrium.</span></li>
    <li>Are the concentrations of reactants and products always the same at equilibrium?<span class="answer">→ No, they can differ.</span></li>
    <li>What is meant by the “position of equilibrium”?<span class="answer">→ It shows whether there are more products or more reactants.</span></li>
    <li>When there are more products, which side does the equilibrium lie on?<span class="answer">→ To the right.</span></li>
    <li>When there are more reactants, which side does the equilibrium lie on?<span class="answer">→ To the left.</span></li>
    <li>Can the position of equilibrium change?<span class="answer">→ Yes.</span></li>
    <li>What factor can move the position of equilibrium to the right?<span class="answer">→ Heating (for endothermic forward reactions).</span></li>
    <li>What factor can move it to the left?<span class="answer">→ Cooling.</span></li>
    <li>When we heat the ammonium chloride reaction, what happens?<span class="answer">→ It shifts to the right (more NH₃ and HCl).</span></li>
    <li>When we cool the reaction, which direction is favored?<span class="answer">→ The left (more NH₄Cl forms).</span></li>
    <li>What kind of system is needed for equilibrium to be reached?<span class="answer">→ A closed system.</span></li>
    <li>What does a closed system mean?<span class="answer">→ Nothing can enter or leave — reactants and products stay inside.</span></li>
    <li>Why can’t equilibrium be reached in an open system?<span class="answer">→ Because escaping products prevent balance.</span></li>
    <li>What are the two types of energy changes involved in reversible reactions?<span class="answer">→ Endothermic and exothermic.</span></li>
    <li>Is one direction of a reversible reaction endothermic or exothermic?<span class="answer">→ One is endothermic.</span></li>
    <li>Which direction is the reverse reaction in terms of heat flow?<span class="answer">→ It is exothermic.</span></li>
    <li>What does “endothermic” mean?<span class="answer">→ Absorbs heat from surroundings.</span></li>
    <li>What does “exothermic” mean?<span class="answer">→ Releases heat to surroundings.</span></li>
    <li>What color is hydrated copper sulfate?<span class="answer">→ Blue.</span></li>
    <li>What color is anhydrous copper sulfate?<span class="answer">→ White.</span></li>
    <li>What happens when hydrated copper sulfate is heated?<span class="answer">→ It loses water and turns white (anhydrous form).</span></li>
    <li>What happens when water is added back to the anhydrous copper sulfate?<span class="answer">→ It turns blue again (hydrated form).</span></li>
    <li>Which direction (forward or backward) is exothermic in the copper sulfate example?<span class="answer">→ The backward (hydration) reaction.</span></li>
    <li>At equilibrium, what must be true about the forward and backward rates?<span class="answer">→ They are equal.</span></li>
    <li>What happens to the position of equilibrium when temperature conditions change?<span class="answer">→ It shifts left or right depending on whether heating or cooling occurs.</span></li>
