  <h1>Metals and Non-metals Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Where are most metals found on the periodic table?<br>→ Towards the bottom left.</li>
    <li>Are most elements metals or non-metals?<br>→ Metals.</li>
    <li>What kind of ions do metals form?<br>→ Positive ions.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a positive ion formed by a metal.<br>→ Calcium ion (Ca²⁺).</li>
    <li>What kind of ions do non-metals usually form?<br>→ Negative ions.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a negative ion.<br>→ Chloride ion (Cl⁻).</li>
    <li>Why do atoms react?<br>→ To achieve a full outer electron shell.</li>
    <li>What do atoms want in their outer shell?<br>→ A full set of electrons.</li>
    <li>What kind of elements are found on the left side of the periodic table?<br>→ Metals with few outer electrons.</li>
    <li>How many outer electrons does calcium have?<br>→ Two.</li>
    <li>Why can calcium easily form a positive ion?<br>→ It only needs to lose two electrons.</li>
    <li>How many electrons does chlorine have in its outer shell?<br>→ Seven.</li>
    <li>Why can’t chlorine easily form a positive ion?<br>→ It would need to lose seven electrons, which requires too much energy.</li>
    <li>Which part of the periodic table has the most reactive metals?<br>→ The bottom of a group.</li>
    <li>Why are metals more reactive down a group?<br>→ Their outer electrons are farther from the nucleus and easier to lose.</li>
    <li>How many electron shells does lead (Pb) have?<br>→ Six.</li>
    <li>Why does the nucleus hold outer electrons less strongly in heavy metals?<br>→ The outer electrons are far from the positive nucleus.</li>
    <li>What happens when an atom loses electrons?<br>→ It forms a positive ion.</li>
    <li>Why do metals further down the group lose electrons more easily?<br>→ The nucleus has a weaker hold on distant outer electrons.</li>
    <li>What type of bonding do all metals have?<br>→ Metallic bonding.</li>
    <li>Are metallic bonds strong or weak?<br>→ Strong.</li>
    <li>What does “malleable” mean?<br>→ Can be bent or hammered into shape without breaking.</li>
    <li>Why can metals be used in wires?<br>→ They conduct electricity well.</li>
    <li>Do metals have high or low melting points?<br>→ High.</li>
    <li>What does “sonorous” mean?<br>→ Makes a ringing sound when struck.</li>
    <li>Give two properties of metals.<br>→ Strong and shiny (also conductive, malleable).</li>
    <li>What is the appearance of non-metals?<br>→ Dull in color.</li>
    <li>Are non-metals brittle or flexible?<br>→ Brittle.</li>
    <li>Do non-metals have high or low melting points?<br>→ Low.</li>
    <li>Are many non-metals solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature?<br>→ Gas.</li>
    <li>Are non-metals good or poor conductors of electricity?<br>→ Poor conductors.</li>
    <li>Do non-metals have high or low density?<br>→ Low density.</li>
    <li>Where are transition metals found on the periodic table?<br>→ In the center.</li>
    <li>What are transition metals considered to be?<br>→ Typical metals.</li>
    <li>Can transition metals form more than one ion?<br>→ Yes, they can.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a transition metal that forms several ions.<br>→ Chromium (Cr²⁺, Cr³⁺, Cr⁶⁺).</li>
    <li>What colors can transition metal ions be?<br>→ Blue, green, or orange.</li>
    <li>What do catalysts do in chemical reactions?<br>→ Speed up the reaction.</li>
    <li>Is a catalyst used up during a reaction?<br>→ No, it is not used up.</li>
    <li>Name one transition metal used as a catalyst and the process it’s used in.<br>→ Iron in the Haber process (to make ammonia).</li>
