    <li>Temperature, concentration or pressure, surface area, and the presence of a catalyst.</li>
    <li>Collision theory.</li>
    <li>They must collide with each other.</li>
    <li>Activation energy.</li>
    <li>They bounce apart and no reaction occurs.</li>
    <li>The energy of the particles and the frequency of collisions.</li>
    <li>More energy increases the chance of exceeding the activation energy.</li>
    <li>How often particles collide with each other.</li>
    <li>Because even if some collisions are unsuccessful, more attempts lead to more successes.</li>
    <li>Their effect on particle energy and collision frequency.</li>
    <li>The particles gain more energy.</li>
    <li>They move faster.</li>
    <li>Faster movement causes more frequent collisions.</li>
    <li>Because each collision transfers more energy and is more likely to exceed activation energy.</li>
    <li>The number of particles per unit volume.</li>
    <li>Solutions.</li>
    <li>Gases.</li>
    <li>There are more particles per unit volume.</li>
    <li>More particles mean more frequent collisions.</li>
    <li>It increases the rate of reaction.</li>
    <li>It increases the area where particles can collide.</li>
    <li>The powdered form.</li>
    <li>It has more exposed surface for collisions with the acid.</li>
    <li>A substance that speeds up a reaction without being used up.</li>
    <li>Because they are not reactants or products.</li>
    <li>The change in energy during a reaction.</li>
    <li>Activation energy.</li>
    <li>It lowers it.</li>
    <li>More collisions will have enough energy to react.</li>
    <li>It gives a different route for the reaction with a lower energy barrier.</li>
    <li>Transition metals.</li>
    <li>Cobalt and nickel.</li>
    <li>Enzymes.</li>
    <li>Because they speed up reactions in living organisms without being used up.</li>
    <li>They did not have enough energy to reach activation energy.</li>
    <li>It increases both the energy of collisions and their frequency.</li>
    <li>More surface is exposed for collisions to take place.</li>
    <li>Because they are not consumed during the reaction.</li>
    <li>Enough energy to reach or exceed the activation energy.</li>
    <li>A higher rate of reaction.</li>
