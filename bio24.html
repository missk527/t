  <h1>Plant Organization and Leaf Structure Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What levels of organization do plants have?<br>→ Cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.</li>
    <li>What do similar plant cells combine to form?<br>→ Tissues.</li>
    <li>What do different types of tissues combine to form?<br>→ Organs.</li>
    <li>What do multiple organs combine to form?<br>→ Organ systems.</li>
    <li>What is the leaf classified as?<br>→ An organ.</li>
    <li>Which plant parts form the transport organ system?<br>→ The leaf, stem, and roots.</li>
    <li>What is the main function of the leaf system?<br>→ To transport substances around the plant.</li>
    <li>What is shown when we look at a leaf cross-section?<br>→ The internal structure of the leaf.</li>
    <li>What is the main function of leaves?<br>→ Photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>What two materials are needed for photosynthesis?<br>→ Carbon dioxide and water.</li>
    <li>Where does the water for photosynthesis come from?<br>→ From the soil.</li>
    <li>Through which tissue is water transported upward?<br>→ Xylem.</li>
    <li>How does carbon dioxide enter the leaf?<br>→ By diffusion from the outside air.</li>
    <li>What are the tiny holes on a leaf surface called?<br>→ Stomata.</li>
    <li>Where are most stomata located?<br>→ On the lower epidermis.</li>
    <li>What type of tissue forms the lower epidermis?<br>→ Epidermal tissue.</li>
    <li>After entering through stomata, where does carbon dioxide move next?<br>→ Into the spongy mesophyll tissue.</li>
    <li>Why does the spongy mesophyll have air spaces?<br>→ To allow gases to diffuse easily through the leaf.</li>
    <li>What is the next layer after the spongy mesophyll?<br>→ The palisade mesophyll layer.</li>
    <li>Which leaf layer contains many chloroplasts?<br>→ The palisade mesophyll.</li>
    <li>What process happens mainly in the palisade layer?<br>→ Photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>Why are upper epidermis cells nearly transparent?<br>→ To let sunlight pass through to the palisade cells below.</li>
    <li>Which two tissues form the leaf’s transport tubes?<br>→ Xylem and phloem.</li>
    <li>What does the phloem carry away from the leaf?<br>→ Sugars made by photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>What does the xylem bring to the leaf?<br>→ Water from the roots.</li>
    <li>What problem do leaves face on both surfaces?<br>→ Water loss.</li>
    <li>What is the purpose of the waxy cuticle?<br>→ To reduce water loss from the leaf.</li>
    <li>What is the waxy cuticle made of?<br>→ Lipids (a thin waterproof layer).</li>
    <li>Why can water easily diffuse out from stomata?<br>→ Because they are open gaps to the air.</li>
    <li>Why must leaves keep stomata open for a short time only?<br>→ To absorb enough carbon dioxide but minimize water loss.</li>
    <li>What are the cells that control the opening of each stoma called?<br>→ Guard cells.</li>
    <li>What happens to guard cells when the plant has plenty of water?<br>→ They become turgid and open the stomata.</li>
    <li>What term describes hydrated guard cells?<br>→ Turgid.</li>
    <li>What happens to guard cells when the plant loses water?<br>→ They become flaccid and close the stomata.</li>
    <li>What term describes water-deficient guard cells?<br>→ Flaccid.</li>
    <li>Why do guard cells close stomata at night?<br>→ Because photosynthesis stops and carbon dioxide isn’t needed.</li>
    <li>Why are most stomata found on the underside of the leaf?<br>→ It’s cooler and shaded, so less water evaporates.</li>
    <li>What tissue acts like plant stem cells?<br>→ Meristem tissue.</li>
    <li>Where are meristem tissues found?<br>→ At the growing tips of roots and shoots.</li>
    <li>What can meristem cells do as the plant grows?<br>→ Differentiate into many types of plant cells.</li>
