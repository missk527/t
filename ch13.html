<h1>Answer Key – Ions and Groups (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>An ion is a charged particle.</li>
<li>Yes. An ion can be a group of atoms, for example hydroxide.</li>
<li>Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons.</li>
<li>Because a full outer shell makes them more stable (lower energy).</li>
<li>It tells you how many electrons are in the atom’s outermost shell.</li>
<li>Group 1 atoms have 1 outer electron.</li>
<li>Group 2 atoms have 2 outer electrons.</li>
<li>Group 6 atoms have 6 outer electrons.</li>
<li>Group 7 atoms have 7 outer electrons.</li>
<li>Because moving 3 or 4 electrons requires a lot of energy.</li>
<li>They only need to lose 1 electron to get a full outer shell, which needs little energy.</li>
<li>They usually have a 1⁺ charge.</li>
<li>They only need to lose 2 electrons to get a full outer shell.</li>
<li>They usually have a 2⁺ charge.</li>
<li>It must gain 2 electrons.</li>
<li>They usually have a 2⁻ charge.</li>
<li>It must gain 1 electron.</li>
<li>They usually have a 1⁻ charge.</li>
<li>Because they would have to lose or gain three or four electrons, which needs too much energy.</li>
<li>Groups 1, 2, 6 and 7.</li>
<li>The sodium atom loses one electron and becomes a sodium ion.</li>
<li>The electron is lost and written on the right-hand side.</li>
<li>It loses electrons.</li>
<li>On the right-hand side of the equation.</li>
<li>On the left-hand side of the equation.</li>
<li>The chlorine atom gains one electron and becomes a chloride ion.</li>
<li>The chloride ion has a 1⁻ charge.</li>
<li>Two electrons are lost.</li>
<li>The magnesium ion has a 2⁺ charge.</li>
<li>Two electrons are gained.</li>
<li>The oxide ion has a 2⁻ charge.</li>
<li>A cation.</li>
<li>An anion.</li>
<li>It will have a 1⁺ charge.</li>
<li>It will have a 2⁻ charge.</li>
<li>Metals usually form positive ions.</li>
<li>Non-metals usually form negative ions.</li>
<li>Because energy is required to remove or add electrons.</li>
<li>Because moving only one or two electrons needs less energy, so it happens more easily.</li>
<li>Because their atoms only need to gain or lose one or two electrons to get a full outer shell, so they form ions easily.</li>
