<h1>Answer Key – Viruses (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Viruses are not cells.</li>
<li>They are usually described as non-living (though treated as organisms in biology).</li>
<li>They are about 10,000 times smaller than animal cells.</li>
<li>No, they cannot reproduce by themselves outside other cells.</li>
<li>They need to get inside another organism’s cell.</li>
<li>They use the host cell’s own machinery to make copies of themselves.</li>
<li>The host cell can burst.</li>
<li>Because bursting and destroying our cells damages tissues and makes us feel ill.</li>
<li>Three viral diseases.</li>
<li>Measles, HIV and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).</li>
<li>By droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
<li>A red rash across most of the body.</li>
<li>A fever is a very high body temperature with feeling generally unwell.</li>
<li>Yes, measles can be very serious and sometimes fatal.</li>
<li>Because nearly everyone is vaccinated against measles when they are young.</li>
<li>Human Immunodeficiency Virus.</li>
<li>It tells us that the virus infects humans.</li>
<li>It means the immune system is deficient or not working properly.</li>
<li>We are talking about the virus itself.</li>
<li>Through unprotected sex.</li>
<li>Sharing needles can transfer blood that contains HIV.</li>
<li>Flu-like symptoms such as fever, tiredness and aches.</li>
<li>They usually feel better again and think everything is fine.</li>
<li>It continues to damage and weaken their immune system.</li>
<li>They start to get unusual infections and sometimes cancers.</li>
<li>AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).</li>
<li>They often died from random infections or cancers.</li>
<li>Antiretroviral drugs.</li>
<li>They prevent the HIV viruses from replicating in the body.</li>
<li>They can often go on to live normal lives.</li>
<li>Tobacco Mosaic Virus.</li>
<li>It infects plants.</li>
<li>Tobacco plants and tomato plants.</li>
<li>A mosaic pattern on the leaves.</li>
<li>They become discoloured in patches.</li>
<li>Photosynthesis cannot take place properly there.</li>
<li>Sugars.</li>
<li>The plant cannot grow properly and has poor overall growth.</li>
<li>Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).</li>
<li>Viruses infect our cells, use them to replicate, and then burst and destroy them, damaging our bodies.</li>
