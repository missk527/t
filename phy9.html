  <h1>Energy Resources — Questions & Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What was humanity’s main source of energy for most of history?<br>→ Wood.</li>
    <li>What were two main uses of wood as an energy source?<br>→ Heating and cooking.</li>
    <li>Around how many years ago did energy use start changing dramatically?<br>→ About 200 years ago.</li>
    <li>What do many people in developing countries still rely on for energy?<br>→ Wood.</li>
    <li>Name three examples of non-renewable energy resources.<br>→ Coal, oil, and natural gas.</li>
    <li>What term is used to describe coal, oil, and natural gas collectively?<br>→ Fossil fuels.</li>
    <li>What is another type of non-renewable energy mentioned besides fossil fuels?<br>→ Nuclear energy.</li>
    <li>In the past 50 years, which type of energy resources have risen rapidly in use?<br>→ Renewable resources.</li>
    <li>Name three renewable energy resources mentioned in the speech.<br>→ Solar, wind, and hydroelectric.</li>
    <li>What are biofuels made from?<br>→ Plants or other organic matter (biomass).</li>
    <li>What is tidal energy generated by?<br>→ The movement of tides (sea water).</li>
    <li>In the UK, most energy is used for which two sectors?<br>→ Transport and domestic uses.</li>
    <li>What does “transport” refer to in this context?<br>→ Vehicles such as cars, trains, planes, and ships.</li>
    <li>Give two examples of transport vehicles listed in the speech.<br>→ Cars and trains.</li>
    <li>What two fuels are mainly used for road vehicles?<br>→ Petrol and diesel.</li>
    <li>Which fuel is used for airplanes?<br>→ Kerosene.</li>
    <li>What type of fuel is kerosene made from?<br>→ Oil (a fossil fuel).</li>
    <li>What were trains traditionally powered by?<br>→ Coal.</li>
    <li>What major historical event was driven by coal-powered trains?<br>→ The Industrial Revolution.</li>
    <li>What powers most trains today?<br>→ Electricity.</li>
    <li>What renewable transport fuel is made from plants?<br>→ Biofuels.</li>
    <li>What trend has been increasing in road transport recently?<br>→ The use of biofuels and electric cars.</li>
    <li>What does “domestic uses” mean?<br>→ Energy used in households.</li>
    <li>Give two examples of domestic uses of energy.<br>→ Cooking and heating.</li>
    <li>What is the UK’s main energy source for heating?<br>→ Natural gas.</li>
    <li>What is natural gas burned to heat?<br>→ Water.</li>
    <li>How is thermal energy from hot water transferred to rooms?<br>→ Through radiators.</li>
    <li>Name another non-renewable fuel used in fireplaces for heat.<br>→ Coal.</li>
    <li>What do solar water heaters use to heat water?<br>→ The Sun’s energy.</li>
    <li>How can biofuels be used for heating?<br>→ They can be burned like coal.</li>
    <li>What determines whether electricity is renewable or non-renewable?<br>→ How it is generated.</li>
    <li>Is electricity itself considered renewable or non-renewable?<br>→ Neither; it depends on the energy source.</li>
    <li>What does the UK electricity pie chart show as the main source?<br>→ Fossil fuels.</li>
    <li>Roughly what percentage of UK electricity comes from fossil fuels?<br>→ About 60%.</li>
    <li>What percentage of UK electricity comes from non-renewable sources in total?<br>→ Nearly 80%.</li>
    <li>What conclusion can be made about the majority of UK electricity sources?<br>→ They are non-renewable.</li>
    <li>Why is electricity considered an energy carrier rather than a resource?<br>→ Because it depends on other sources for production.</li>
    <li>What type of energy transfer occurs when radiators warm a room?<br>→ Thermal energy transfer to the air.</li>
    <li>Which renewable heating system uses sunlight directly?<br>→ Solar water heaters.</li>
    <li>What is the main environmental advantage of using renewable energy sources?<br>→ They reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower pollution.</li>
