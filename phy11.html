1. Thermal energy
2. Stored in the Earth’s crust
3. Heat from Earth’s initial formation
4. Radioactive decay (e.g., uranium)
5. Hot springs
6. Direct heating and electricity generation
7. Direct heating is cheaper
8. Water
9. It warms up underground
10. To heat homes / buildings
11. It heats up until it becomes steam
12. The steam rises
13. It turns turbines
14. Generators produce electricity
15. Because steam can turn turbines, warm water cannot
16. No, only possible in certain areas
17. Volcanic regions / places with hot rocks near the surface
18. Because hot rocks lie close to the surface
19. Power plants can be expensive to build
20. Carbon dioxide (no CO₂ pollution)
21. Only slight environmental damage during installation
22. Renewable
23. Yes, it is reliable long-term
24. Because the Earth’s heat continues naturally
25. The Earth’s crust
26. Uranium
27. It releases heat
28. Steam
29. Because steam is less dense and rises
30. Steam turns the turbines
31. It needs less equipment and no generators/turbines
32. Warm water
33. Carbon dioxide (none produced)
34. Yes
35. A geothermal power plant
36. High construction cost
37. Reliable
38. Hot rocks near the surface
39. Because hot underground heat is not available everywhere
40. Produces no pollutants while running and causes only slight environmental damage
