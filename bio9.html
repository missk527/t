  <h1>Exchange and Surface Area to Volume Ratio Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What must an organism do to survive in its environment?<br>→ Exchange substances with its environment.</li>
    <li>What are useful substances taken in by organisms called?<br>→ Nutrients or useful substrates.</li>
    <li>What do organisms excrete when they remove materials they don’t need?<br>→ Waste products.</li>
    <li>What term describes keeping a stable internal environment?<br>→ Homeostasis.</li>
    <li>How do single-celled organisms exchange substances with their environment?<br>→ Directly through their cell surface or cell wall.</li>
    <li>Why can single-celled organisms exchange substances easily?<br>→ They are very small, so substances diffuse quickly across the surface.</li>
    <li>What feature of small organisms allows fast diffusion?<br>→ A large surface area to volume ratio.</li>
    <li>What does “surface area to volume ratio” mean?<br>→ The amount of surface area available for exchange compared to the organism’s volume.</li>
    <li>What happens to the surface area to volume ratio as an organism gets larger?<br>→ It decreases.</li>
    <li>What effect does a smaller surface area to volume ratio have on diffusion rate?<br>→ Diffusion becomes slower and less efficient.</li>
    <li>Why can’t large organisms rely only on diffusion?<br>→ It would take too long to transport substances to all cells.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a single-celled organism mentioned in the speech.<br>→ Bacteria.</li>
    <li>In bacteria, which gas diffuses into the cell during respiration?<br>→ Oxygen.</li>
    <li>In bacteria, which gas diffuses out as waste during respiration?<br>→ Carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>What is the surface area of a cube with sides of 1 cm?<br>→ 6 cm².</li>
    <li>What is the volume of a cube with sides of 1 cm?<br>→ 1 cm³.</li>
    <li>What is the surface area of a cube with sides of 10 cm?<br>→ 600 cm².</li>
    <li>What is the volume of a cube with sides of 10 cm?<br>→ 1000 cm³.</li>
    <li>What is the surface area to volume ratio of the 1 cm cube (the “mouse”)?<br>→ 6 : 1.</li>
    <li>What is the surface area to volume ratio of the 10 cm cube (the “elephant”)?<br>→ 0.6 : 1.</li>
    <li>What does the cube example show about size and surface area to volume ratio?<br>→ As organisms get bigger, their SA : V ratio becomes smaller.</li>
    <li>Why do larger organisms need specialized exchange systems?<br>→ Because diffusion alone is too slow to meet their needs.</li>
    <li>Name one example of a specialized exchange surface in animals.<br>→ Alveoli in the lungs.</li>
    <li>Name one example of a specialized exchange surface in plants.<br>→ Leaves or root hair cells.</li>
    <li>What are the small structures in the lungs that exchange gases called?<br>→ Alveoli.</li>
    <li>What are the structures in the small intestine that absorb nutrients called?<br>→ Villi.</li>
    <li>What plant structure increases water and mineral absorption?<br>→ Root hair cells.</li>
    <li>What structure allows gas exchange in fish?<br>→ Gills.</li>
    <li>What is the first general feature of an effective exchange surface?<br>→ A large surface area relative to its volume.</li>
    <li>How does a large surface area help diffusion?<br>→ It allows more particles to pass through at once.</li>
    <li>What is the second feature of an effective exchange surface?<br>→ Very thin membranes.</li>
    <li>Why are thin membranes important for diffusion?<br>→ They shorten the diffusion distance, speeding up exchange.</li>
    <li>What is the third feature of an effective exchange surface?<br>→ Permeable membranes.</li>
    <li>Why must exchange membranes be permeable?<br>→ So substances can diffuse through them easily.</li>
    <li>What is the fourth feature of an effective exchange surface?<br>→ A maintained diffusion or concentration gradient.</li>
    <li>What provides the diffusion gradient in the lungs?<br>→ A constant supply of oxygen from air entering the lungs.</li>
    <li>How does the bloodstream help maintain a diffusion gradient?<br>→ It continually removes oxygen and brings in carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>What is the role of oxygen in gas exchange?<br>→ It diffuses into the blood for respiration.</li>
    <li>What waste gas is removed during respiration?<br>→ Carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Summarize one reason why diffusion alone is not enough for large organisms.<br>→ Because their small SA : V ratio makes diffusion too slow to supply all cells efficiently.</li>
