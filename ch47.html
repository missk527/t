  <h1>Rates of Reaction from Graphs — Questions & Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the two ways we can calculate the rate of a reaction?<br>→ From the amount of reactant used or the amount of product formed.</li>
    <li>What is the general formula for rate of reaction?<br>→ Rate = change in amount ÷ time.</li>
    <li>In the example, how much hydrogen gas was produced?<br>→ 1,200 cm³.</li>
    <li>How long did the reaction take in the example?<br>→ 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>What was the calculated mean rate of the reaction in cm³/s?<br>→ 5 cm³/s.</li>
    <li>Why does this calculation only give the average rate?<br>→ Because the rate changes during the reaction.</li>
    <li>When is the rate of reaction fastest?<br>→ At the beginning.</li>
    <li>What happens to the rate of reaction as the reaction progresses?<br>→ It slows down.</li>
    <li>On a reaction graph, what is plotted on the x-axis?<br>→ Time.</li>
    <li>On a reaction graph, what is plotted on the y-axis?<br>→ Volume of hydrogen (or product formed).</li>
    <li>What does a steep curve indicate on the graph?<br>→ A fast rate of reaction.</li>
    <li>What does a plateau on the graph show?<br>→ The reaction has finished.</li>
    <li>What causes the reaction to slow down over time?<br>→ Reactants are being used up.</li>
    <li>What two main calculations can be done from a reaction graph?<br>→ Mean rate and rate at a specific time.</li>
    <li>What does “mean rate of reaction” mean?<br>→ The average rate over a time period.</li>
    <li>How do you find the mean rate for the first 3 minutes?<br>→ Find the volume at 3 minutes and divide by time in seconds.</li>
    <li>In the example, how much hydrogen was produced in 3 minutes?<br>→ 1,200 cm³.</li>
    <li>What was the mean rate for the first 3 minutes?<br>→ 6.67 cm³/s.</li>
    <li>What does “rate at a specific time” mean?<br>→ The rate at one instant during the reaction.</li>
    <li>What do we need to draw to find the rate at a specific time?<br>→ A tangent.</li>
    <li>What is a tangent?<br>→ A straight line that just touches the curve at one point.</li>
    <li>How is the tangent related to the curve?<br>→ It has the same gradient as the curve at that point.</li>
    <li>What does the gradient of the tangent represent?<br>→ The rate of reaction at that moment.</li>
    <li>What formula is used to calculate the gradient?<br>→ Gradient = Δy ÷ Δx.</li>
    <li>What does Δy represent in this context?<br>→ The change in volume of hydrogen.</li>
    <li>What does Δx represent in this context?<br>→ The change in time.</li>
    <li>What was the change in hydrogen volume used in the tangent example?<br>→ 600 cm³.</li>
    <li>What was the change in time used in the tangent example?<br>→ 170 seconds (2 minutes 50 seconds).</li>
    <li>What was the calculated rate at 2 minutes in cm³/s?<br>→ 3.53 cm³/s.</li>
    <li>Why is it recommended to make the tangent line long?<br>→ To reduce percentage error in measurement.</li>
    <li>What should you do after drawing the tangent line?<br>→ Measure Δy and Δx to calculate the gradient.</li>
    <li>Why do examiners allow a small range of answers?<br>→ Because the tangent is drawn by eye.</li>
    <li>What should you be careful about when drawing the tangent?<br>→ Make sure it matches the curve’s steepness at that point.</li>
    <li>What type of graph can also be used to find reaction rates besides product-time graphs?<br>→ A graph of reactant remaining vs time.</li>
    <li>In the magnesium example, what was the starting mass?<br>→ 1.2 g.</li>
    <li>What was the change in mass (Δy) at 1 minute?<br>→ 0.72 g.</li>
    <li>What was the change in time (Δx) at 1 minute?<br>→ 100 seconds (1 minute 40 seconds).</li>
    <li>What was the calculated rate in g/s for that reaction?<br>→ 0.0072 g/s.</li>
    <li>Why is it okay if the tangent is a little longer or shorter?<br>→ The gradient stays the same if steepness is correct.</li>
    <li>What ensures you will get the same rate even if your tangent size differs?<br>→ Keeping the same slope (steepness) as the curve at that point.</li>
