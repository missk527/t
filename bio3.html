    <li>It involves transferring a useful gene from one organism to another to give the recipient the same trait.</li>
    <li>A gene responsible for a desirable characteristic.</li>
    <li>It develops the same trait as the donor organism.</li>
    <li>Genetically modified (GM) organism.</li>
    <li>No, genes can be transferred between different species.</li>
    <li>A plant with lots of big fruit.</li>
    <li>It allows traits to be shared across species.</li>
    <li>They have been engineered to produce drugs in their milk.</li>
    <li>The drugs can be extracted to treat human diseases.</li>
    <li>Insulin.</li>
    <li>Diabetes.</li>
    <li>Improved fruit size and quality, resistance to diseases, insects, or herbicides.</li>
    <li>By improving the size and quality of their fruits.</li>
    <li>A process that introduces a healthy version of a faulty gene to treat inherited disorders.</li>
    <li>To fix the problem caused by the faulty gene.</li>
    <li>Because the faulty gene is present in all of a person's cells.</li>
    <li>In all of the person’s cells.</li>
    <li>Transferring the healthy gene at the egg or embryo stage.</li>
    <li>The healthy gene will be passed on to all developing cells.</li>
    <li>Producing more food with desirable traits at lower cost.</li>
    <li>Because people in those countries still die from starvation.</li>
    <li>Beta-carotene (spelled “betaarotene” in the speech).</li>
    <li>It helps prevent blindness.</li>
    <li>Long-term health effects are not known with 100% certainty.</li>
    <li>No, there is no current evidence they are harmful.</li>
    <li>GM plants might outcompete local plants and alter ecosystems.</li>
    <li>Because they are designed to survive in farms, not in the wild.</li>
    <li>Finding and isolating the desired gene.</li>
    <li>Enzymes.</li>
    <li>A carrier used to transfer a gene into another organism.</li>
    <li>Viruses and bacterial plasmids.</li>
    <li>Small loops of DNA found in bacteria.</li>
    <li>The vector is introduced into the target organism.</li>
    <li>A pig or a plant (or any target organism).</li>
    <li>They take up the gene and start using it.</li>
    <li>Proteins.</li>
    <li>It may replace the faulty gene with a healthy one.</li>
    <li>Reaching every cell is extremely difficult.</li>
    <li>By producing better crops with desirable traits more efficiently.</li>
    <li>They could spread into the wild and disrupt local ecosystems.</li>
