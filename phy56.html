<h1>Answers – Newton’s First & Second Laws, Circular Motion, and Inertia</h1>
<ol>
<li>Newton’s First Law says that an object’s motion will not change unless a resultant force acts on it.</li>
<li>A resultant (net) force is required to change the motion of an object.</li>
<li>If the resultant force is zero, the object’s motion stays the same — no change in speed or direction.</li>
<li>A stationary object with zero resultant force will remain stationary.</li>
<li>A moving object with zero resultant force will continue moving at constant velocity.</li>
<li>Newton’s Second Law says a non-zero resultant force causes acceleration.</li>
<li>No, acceleration can mean speeding up, slowing down, starting, stopping, or changing direction.</li>
<li>It would speed up.</li>
<li>It would slow down or stop, because the force acts opposite the motion.</li>
<li>Yes, acceleration can change only direction while keeping the same speed.</li>
<li>Because velocity depends on both speed and direction, so changing direction means changing velocity.</li>
<li>Velocity is determined by speed and direction.</li>
<li>Yes, the Moon is accelerating.</li>
<li>Because its direction constantly changes as it orbits Earth.</li>
<li>The gravitational force of Earth keeps the Moon in orbit.</li>
<li>The inward force acts perpendicular to motion, toward the center (centripetal).</li>
<li>The mass of the particle was 0.25 kg.</li>
<li>The forces were 30 N to the left and 42 N to the right.</li>
<li>The resultant force was 12 N to the right (42 − 30).</li>
<li>The equation is F = m a.</li>
<li>Rearranged: a = F / m.</li>
<li>The acceleration was 48 m/s² (12 ÷ 0.25).</li>
<li>If the resultant force doubles, acceleration also doubles.</li>
<li>If mass increases, acceleration decreases (for the same force).</li>
<li>Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion.</li>
<li>An object at rest will stay at rest.</li>
<li>An object in motion will stay in motion at constant velocity.</li>
<li>Inertial mass measures how difficult it is to change an object’s velocity.</li>
<li>Inertial mass = force ÷ acceleration (m = F / a).</li>
<li>A large mass needs more force to change its velocity.</li>
<li>For a given force, a large mass has small acceleration.</li>
<li>If no resultant force acts, velocity does not change.</li>
<li>No — it might slow down, stop, or change direction, not only speed up.</li>
<li>A force that is not zero is called a non-zero resultant force.</li>
<li>The symbol for force is F.</li>
<li>The symbol for mass is m.</li>
<li>The symbol for acceleration is a.</li>
<li>Force is measured in newtons (N).</li>
<li>Acceleration is measured in metres per second squared (m/s²).</li>
<li>In circular motion, speed is constant but velocity changes because the direction is constantly changing.</li>
