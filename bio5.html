<h1>Answer Key – Diffusion (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>They move about randomly.</li>
<li>They spread out and become evenly distributed.</li>
<li>Diffusion.</li>
<li>The spreading out of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.</li>
<li>From higher concentration to lower concentration.</li>
<li>Random.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Because their random movement causes them to spread out by chance.</li>
<li>In gases and in solutions.</li>
<li>The perfume particles diffuse through the air.</li>
<li>The squash particles diffuse through the water.</li>
<li>Through partially permeable membranes.</li>
<li>Only some particles can pass through them.</li>
<li>Very small molecules.</li>
<li>Glucose and oxygen (or water or amino acids).</li>
<li>Starch and proteins.</li>
<li>In the fluid inside or outside the cell.</li>
<li>In the blood vessels.</li>
<li>In the surrounding cells.</li>
<li>For cellular respiration to release energy.</li>
<li>The difference in concentration between the blood and the cells.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide.</li>
<li>Inside the cells.</li>
<li>Out of the cells into the bloodstream.</li>
<li>The blood takes the carbon dioxide away.</li>
<li>It keeps the concentration in the blood low.</li>
<li>The difference in concentration between two areas.</li>
<li>It increases the rate of diffusion.</li>
<li>Higher temperature increases the rate of diffusion.</li>
<li>It gives particles more energy so they move faster.</li>
<li>It affects how much space particles have to pass through.</li>
<li>More area allows more particles to diffuse at once.</li>
<li>Alveoli and intestinal cells.</li>
<li>How fast diffusion happens.</li>
<li>Because the molecules are too large to fit through the membrane.</li>
<li>By allowing oxygen and glucose to enter cells.</li>
<li>Because random movement eventually spreads particles out.</li>
<li>Because particles move until concentrations balance out.</li>
<li>The concentration gradient keeps it going.</li>
<li>Concentration gradient, temperature, and surface area.</li>
