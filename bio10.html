  <h1>Human Body Organization Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What kind of organisms are human beings?<br>→ Multicellular organisms.</li>
    <li>Why are humans described as complex?<br>→ Because they are made up of many different parts and layers.</li>
    <li>How can we understand human complexity according to the speech?<br>→ By breaking everything down into layers.</li>
    <li>What are the basic building blocks of life?<br>→ Cells.</li>
    <li>Name one subcellular structure found in a cell.<br>→ Nucleus.</li>
    <li>Give two examples of subcellular structures mentioned.<br>→ Mitochondria and ribosomes.</li>
    <li>What are most human cells specialized to do?<br>→ To perform a particular function.</li>
    <li>Name one example of a specialized cell.<br>→ Nerve cell.</li>
    <li>Give another example of a specialized cell.<br>→ Muscle cell.</li>
    <li>What do specialized cells combine to form?<br>→ Tissues.</li>
    <li>What do tissues combine to form?<br>→ Organs.</li>
    <li>What do organs combine to form?<br>→ Organ systems.</li>
    <li>What does an organ system form together?<br>→ A complete organism.</li>
    <li>Define a tissue in one sentence.<br>→ A group of similar cells working together to carry out a function.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a tissue in animals.<br>→ Muscle tissue.</li>
    <li>What type of cells make up epithelial tissue?<br>→ Epithelial cells.</li>
    <li>What does epithelial tissue do in the body?<br>→ It lines parts of the body.</li>
    <li>Where in the body can epithelial tissue be found?<br>→ In the lungs and intestines.</li>
    <li>What plant is used as an example in the speech?<br>→ A plant with xylem cells (general plant example).</li>
    <li>What type of plant cell forms xylem?<br>→ Xylem cells.</li>
    <li>What is the function of xylem tissue?<br>→ To transport water up the stem.</li>
    <li>What do different types of tissue form?<br>→ Organs.</li>
    <li>Name one organ mentioned in the speech.<br>→ Heart.</li>
    <li>Name another organ mentioned.<br>→ Stomach (or brain, pancreas, kidneys).</li>
    <li>List two less well-known organs mentioned.<br>→ Teeth and tendons (also bronchi, salivary glands).</li>
    <li>What organ system includes the heart?<br>→ Cardiovascular system.</li>
    <li>What organ system helps digest food?<br>→ Digestive system.</li>
    <li>What organ system controls movement?<br>→ Muscular system.</li>
    <li>What is an organ made of?<br>→ Different tissues working together.</li>
    <li>What is a tissue made of?<br>→ Similar cells with the same function.</li>
    <li>What are cells made up of?<br>→ Subcellular structures like nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes.</li>
    <li>What does the nucleus do inside a cell?<br>→ It controls the cell’s activities (implied).</li>
    <li>What is the mitochondria responsible for?<br>→ Energy production (implied from general knowledge in the context).</li>
    <li>What is the function of ribosomes?<br>→ Protein synthesis (implied from the context).</li>
    <li>What does “specialized cell” mean?<br>→ A cell adapted for a particular function.</li>
    <li>Which part of the body do bronchi belong to?<br>→ The lungs (respiratory system).</li>
    <li>Which glands help produce saliva?<br>→ Salivary glands.</li>
    <li>What is the order of organization from smallest to largest?<br>→ Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organ systems → Organism.</li>
    <li>What word describes an organism made of many cells?<br>→ Multicellular.</li>
    <li>According to the speech, what will be covered in future videos?<br>→ More detailed looks at individual organ systems.</li>
