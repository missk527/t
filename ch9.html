  <h1>Periodic Table — Short Questions with Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Who devised the periodic table?<br>→ Dmitri Mendeleev.</li>
    <li>What nationality was Mendeleev?<br>→ Russian.</li>
    <li>In which century did Mendeleev create the periodic table?<br>→ The 19th century.</li>
    <li>What did the periodic table organize?<br>→ All known elements.</li>
    <li>What did Mendeleev’s table predict?<br>→ New elements not yet discovered.</li>
    <li>What is everything in the universe made from?<br>→ Different combinations of elements.</li>
    <li>How is the periodic table read?<br>→ From left to right, then top to bottom.</li>
    <li>What are elements arranged by in the periodic table?<br>→ Increasing atomic number.</li>
    <li>What does the atomic number represent?<br>→ The number of protons in the atom.</li>
    <li>Where is the atomic number usually found in an element’s box?<br>→ At the bottom left.</li>
    <li>What does the mass number represent?<br>→ The total number of protons and neutrons.</li>
    <li>Where is the mass number usually shown in an element’s box?<br>→ At the top left.</li>
    <li>What does the elemental symbol represent?<br>→ The one- or two-letter symbol of the element.</li>
    <li>What is the elemental symbol for sodium?<br>→ Na.</li>
    <li>What does the atomic number tell us about an element?<br>→ How many protons its atoms have.</li>
    <li>What does the mass number tell us?<br>→ The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</li>
    <li>What repeating feature did Mendeleev notice about the elements?<br>→ Patterns of chemical properties repeated at regular intervals.</li>
    <li>What is a “period” on the periodic table?<br>→ A horizontal row of elements.</li>
    <li>What is a “group” on the periodic table?<br>→ A vertical column of elements with similar properties.</li>
    <li>How are the elements in a group related?<br>→ They have similar chemical properties.</li>
    <li>How many groups are there from the far left to the far right?<br>→ Seven (plus group 0).</li>
    <li>What is the far-right group called?<br>→ Group 0 (the noble gases).</li>
    <li>Why is the far-right group called group 0 instead of group 8?<br>→ Because their outer shells are full and stable.</li>
    <li>Which block of elements between groups 2 and 3 does not have group numbers?<br>→ The transition metals.</li>
    <li>Why do elements in a group have similar chemical properties?<br>→ They have the same number of outer-shell electrons.</li>
    <li>What determines how an element reacts?<br>→ The number of electrons in its outer shell.</li>
    <li>What does the group number tell you about the electrons?<br>→ How many electrons are in the outer shell.</li>
    <li>How many outer electrons do elements in group 2 have?<br>→ Two.</li>
    <li>How many total electrons do all elements in a group have — same or different?<br>→ Different total numbers of electrons.</li>
    <li>What are group 1 elements called?<br>→ The alkali metals.</li>
    <li>How many outer electrons do group 1 elements have?<br>→ One.</li>
    <li>How do group 1 elements react with water?<br>→ They react violently.</li>
    <li>How does reactivity change as you go down group 1?<br>→ It increases.</li>
    <li>What are group 7 elements called?<br>→ The halogens.</li>
    <li>How many outer electrons do group 7 elements have?<br>→ Seven.</li>
    <li>How does reactivity change as you go down group 7?<br>→ It decreases.</li>
    <li>What are group 0 elements called?<br>→ The noble gases.</li>
    <li>Why are noble gases unreactive?<br>→ They have full outer electron shells.</li>
    <li>What does the zigzag line on the periodic table separate?<br>→ Metals (left) and non-metals (right).</li>
    <li>How can you tell which number is the atomic number on a periodic table?<br>→ It’s the smaller of the two numbers shown.</li>
