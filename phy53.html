  <h1>Distance–Time Graphs — Questions & Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What do distance–time graphs allow us to visualize?<br>→ How far something travels over time.</li>
    <li>What can a distance–time graph show about a journey?<br>→ The total distance, total time, and different stages of motion.</li>
    <li>In the example, how far did the cyclist travel in total?<br>→ 50 meters.</li>
    <li>How long did the cyclist’s journey take?<br>→ 11 seconds.</li>
    <li>What does each section of the graph represent?<br>→ A different part or stage of the journey.</li>
    <li>What does the gradient of the line tell us?<br>→ The speed of the object.</li>
    <li>What is the formula for speed?<br>→ Speed = distance ÷ time.</li>
    <li>How is the gradient calculated on a distance–time graph?<br>→ Change in distance ÷ change in time.</li>
    <li>What does gradient equal on a distance–time graph?<br>→ Speed.</li>
    <li>What is the gradient if an object travels 20 m in 2 seconds?<br>→ 10 m/s.</li>
    <li>What speed does 20 m in 2 seconds represent?<br>→ 10 meters per second (m/s).</li>
    <li>What does a straight line on a distance–time graph show?<br>→ Constant speed.</li>
    <li>What does a flat (horizontal) line mean?<br>→ The object is stationary.</li>
    <li>What is the speed when the gradient is zero?<br>→ Zero.</li>
    <li>What does it mean if the line becomes steeper?<br>→ The object is moving faster.</li>
    <li>What does an increasing gradient indicate?<br>→ Acceleration.</li>
    <li>What does a decreasing gradient indicate?<br>→ Deceleration.</li>
    <li>What term describes when the line gets less steep?<br>→ Deceleration.</li>
    <li>Why is it harder to find the speed on a curved part of the graph?<br>→ Because the speed is constantly changing.</li>
    <li>How can you find speed at a particular time on a curve?<br>→ Draw a tangent at that point and find its gradient.</li>
    <li>What is a tangent?<br>→ A straight line that just touches the curve at one point.</li>
    <li>How is a tangent related to the curve?<br>→ It has the same gradient as the curve at that point.</li>
    <li>What does the gradient of a tangent represent?<br>→ The instantaneous speed at that moment.</li>
    <li>What do you need to know to calculate the gradient?<br>→ The change in distance and change in time.</li>
    <li>What two quantities are divided to find the gradient?<br>→ Change in distance ÷ change in time.</li>
    <li>What is the change in distance in the example for the tangent?<br>→ 12 meters.</li>
    <li>What is the change in time in the tangent example?<br>→ 3 seconds.</li>
    <li>What speed is calculated from 12 m divided by 3 s?<br>→ 4 m/s.</li>
    <li>What does a curved line on a distance–time graph represent?<br>→ Changing speed.</li>
    <li>What do straight lines on a distance–time graph represent?<br>→ Constant speed.</li>
    <li>What do flat lines represent?<br>→ Stationary (no movement).</li>
    <li>What type of line shows acceleration?<br>→ A line that gets steeper.</li>
    <li>What type of line shows deceleration?<br>→ A line that becomes less steep.</li>
    <li>What must you calculate to find speed at a given point?<br>→ The gradient at that point.</li>
    <li>If the point lies on a straight line, how do you find speed?<br>→ Divide the total distance by the total time for that section.</li>
    <li>If the point lies on a curve, what extra step is needed?<br>→ Draw a tangent first, then find its gradient.</li>
    <li>What units are used for speed in the examples?<br>→ Meters per second (m/s).</li>
    <li>What happens to speed when the gradient increases?<br>→ Speed increases.</li>
    <li>What happens to speed when the gradient decreases?<br>→ Speed decreases.</li>
    <li>Summarize the rule connecting gradient and speed on a distance–time graph.<br>→ Gradient = Speed.</li>
