Answer Key
1. Group 1 elements are called alkali metals.
2. Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, francium.
3. They are soft (not strong like most metals).
4. They have low density.
5. They have low melting points.
6. They are more reactive than most metals.
7. They react with water, oxygen, or Group 7 elements (like chlorine).
8. Chlorine.
9. Reactivity increases as you move down the group.
10. Cesium.
11. Melting and boiling points decrease down the group.
12. Table salt (sodium chloride).
13. Because it forms a stable ionic compound, and sodium in salt is not free metal.
14. Because they only need to lose one outer electron to become stable.
15. One electron in the outer shell.
16. They must lose one electron.
17. A +1 ion (one positive charge).
18. Larger atoms hold the outer electron less strongly, so it is easier to lose.
19. Farther from the nucleus.
20. Easier to lose.
21. Ability to lose or gain electrons easily.
22. Because they lose outer electrons easily.
23. They form ionic compounds with non-metals.
24. Sodium donates the electron.
25. They become oppositely charged ions that attract.
26. Electrostatic forces (ionic bond).
27. Sodium chloride.
28. They are white solids and make colorless solutions when dissolved.
29. They form metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
30. Sodium hydroxide + hydrogen gas.
31. The hydrogen gas ignites, producing flames.
32. White metal chloride salts (metal chlorides).
33. Sodium chloride.
34. Metal oxides.
35. Lithium oxide (Li₂O).
36. Sodium oxide (Na₂O).
37. Sodium peroxide (Na₂O₂).
38. Potassium peroxide (K₂O₂) and potassium superoxide (KO₂).
39. From burning hydrogen gas.
40. By using flashcards to memorize the oxide formulas.
