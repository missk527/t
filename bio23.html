  <h1>Tumors and Cancer — 40 Short Questions with Answers</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>What is a common misconception about tumors and cancer?<br>→ That the two terms mean the same thing.</li>
    <li>What is a tumor?<br>→ An abnormal mass of cells.</li>
    <li>What causes a tumor to form?<br>→ Uncontrolled growth and division of cells.</li>
    <li>What are the two main types of tumors?<br>→ Benign and malignant.</li>
    <li>Which type of tumor is considered cancer?<br>→ Malignant tumors.</li>
    <li>What happens to cells in a tumor?<br>→ They grow and divide uncontrollably.</li>
    <li>How is a benign tumor different from a malignant tumor?<br>→ Benign tumors stay in one place; malignant tumors spread.</li>
    <li>Where are benign tumors usually contained?<br>→ Within one area, usually inside a membrane.</li>
    <li>Why are benign tumors not normally dangerous?<br>→ Because they don’t invade or spread to other tissues.</li>
    <li>Do benign tumors spread to other parts of the body?<br>→ No, they remain localized.</li>
    <li>What term is used for tumors that invade other tissues?<br>→ Malignant tumors.</li>
    <li>Why are malignant tumors more dangerous?<br>→ They can invade tissues and spread throughout the body.</li>
    <li>What can malignant tumors form when they spread?<br>→ Secondary tumors.</li>
    <li>What are “secondary tumors”?<br>→ New tumors that form in different parts of the body.</li>
    <li>Why are malignant tumors classified as cancer?<br>→ Because they spread and cause serious damage to tissues.</li>
    <li>What kind of damage can malignant tumors cause to the body?<br>→ They destroy tissues and interfere with organ function.</li>
    <li>Give one lifestyle risk factor that increases the chance of developing cancer.<br>→ Smoking.</li>
    <li>What is one strong link you probably already know about?<br>→ The link between smoking and lung cancer.</li>
    <li>Which cancer is most strongly linked to smoking?<br>→ Lung cancer.</li>
    <li>Name three other cancers linked to smoking.<br>→ Mouth, stomach, and cervical cancers.</li>
    <li>What lifestyle factor besides smoking increases cancer risk?<br>→ Obesity.</li>
    <li>Which cancers are linked to obesity?<br>→ Bowel, liver, and kidney cancers.</li>
    <li>What kind of light exposure is linked to skin cancer?<br>→ Ultraviolet (UV) light.</li>
    <li>Where do humans get ultraviolet light exposure from?<br>→ The sun and sunbeds.</li>
    <li>How does UV radiation cause skin cancer?<br>→ It damages skin cells.</li>
    <li>Which lifestyle habit is linked to an increased risk of liver cancer?<br>→ Drinking alcohol.</li>
    <li>Are all risk factors for cancer lifestyle choices?<br>→ No, some are genetic.</li>
    <li>What kind of risk factors can we inherit?<br>→ Genetic risk factors.</li>
    <li>What do we inherit from our parents that can make us more likely to develop cancer?<br>→ Certain genes.</li>
    <li>What are BRCA genes linked to?<br>→ Increased cancer susceptibility.</li>
    <li>Which two types of cancer are associated with BRCA genes?<br>→ Breast and ovarian cancers.</li>
    <li>Why might obesity increase the risk of certain cancers?<br>→ It affects hormone and cell growth regulation.</li>
    <li>What organ is most affected by alcohol-related cancer?<br>→ The liver.</li>
    <li>What does it mean if cells undergo “uncontrolled growth and division”?<br>→ They multiply without normal regulation, forming tumors.</li>
    <li>Why is it important to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors?<br>→ Because only malignant tumors are cancerous and life-threatening.</li>
    <li>What is the membrane around benign tumors responsible for?<br>→ Containing the tumor in one place.</li>
    <li>What can happen when malignant cells spread to new parts of the body?<br>→ They form secondary tumors.</li>
    <li>Why are malignant tumors potentially fatal?<br>→ They disrupt vital body functions and organs.</li>
    <li>Give two examples of environmental or lifestyle cancer risk factors.<br>→ Smoking and UV light exposure.</li>
    <li>Give one example of a genetic cancer risk factor.<br>→ Inherited BRCA gene mutations.</li>
