<h1>Answer Key – Newton’s Third Law & Acceleration (40 questions)</h1>
<ol>
<li>When two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal and opposite.</li>
<li>They occur whenever two objects interact with each other.</li>
<li>“Equal” refers to the forces having the same magnitude (size).</li>
<li>“Opposite” refers to the forces acting in opposite directions.</li>
<li>The force on you is 100 N.</li>
<li>It acts in the opposite direction to your push on the box.</li>
<li>It is called the normal contact force.</li>
<li>It acts at the point of contact between two solid surfaces.</li>
<li>The small box is more likely to move.</li>
<li>The box might hardly move, and you might be pushed backwards.</li>
<li>Pushing yourself off a wall: you push the wall and the wall pushes you back.</li>
<li>Jumping off the ground: your feet push the ground and the ground pushes you up.</li>
<li>Your feet push downwards on the ground.</li>
<li>The ground pushes you upwards.</li>
<li>Yes, you can be pushed back a little while the box moves forwards a bit.</li>
<li>Newton’s second law.</li>
<li>F stands for force.</li>
<li>m stands for mass.</li>
<li>a stands for acceleration.</li>
<li>a = F / m.</li>
<li>By having a large force or a small mass (or both).</li>
<li>The object with the smaller mass accelerates more.</li>
<li>Because for the same force, a smaller mass gives a larger acceleration (a = F / m).</li>
<li>They act on two different objects.</li>
<li>Because the box always pushes back on you with an equal and opposite force.</li>
<li>It pushes you back with an equal and opposite force.</li>
<li>No, the motions can be very different because the masses can be different.</li>
<li>The mass of the object.</li>
<li>The acceleration becomes smaller.</li>
<li>The acceleration becomes larger.</li>
<li>The smaller object.</li>
<li>Because the wall has a huge mass compared with you, so your acceleration is much larger.</li>
<li>Because the Earth’s mass is enormous, so its acceleration is tiny while yours is noticeable.</li>
<li>It means the two objects are in contact or affecting each other and exerting forces on each other.</li>
<li>You and the box.</li>
<li>You and the wall.</li>
<li>You and the ground (or Earth).</li>
<li>It shows that with the same force, the object with smaller mass has larger acceleration and moves more.</li>
<li>The size of the force on it and its mass.</li>
<li>Because the forces are equal, but its mass is smaller, so its acceleration is larger and it moves more.</li>
